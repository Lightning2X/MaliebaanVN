Peter: Apparently pastor Mulder is taken in again.
Tom: That's his second arrest, isn't it? 
Peter: Well, well. You can count! However it's ourturn to interrogate him. 
Tom: What is he arrested for this time?
Peter: Have you already heard of the anonymous new tip that we received yesterday?
Tom: No, what is it about?
Peter: The person that tipped us about pastor Mulder, thinks he has a connection with the resistance.
Tom: O help, that vague tip must have come from a desperate person of the NSB or Dutch police looking for some money.
Peter: He, don’t talk about our mates like that. Take the case serious Tom. We can proof ourselves!
Tom: Alright, alright, I will. I only hope Mulder stops making it so difficult for himself.
Peter: Hahaha, if he did we won’t have a job and we need food though.

Peter: State your name and occupation please. You'd probably know the drill by now.
Mulder: Jan Mulder, pastor at the local church here at the Lime Tree lane.
Tom: Mr. Mulder? Do you know why you are here again?
Mulder: No not really, just like the last time.
Peter: Don't act innocent! You know what you have done. The fact that you are a pastor does not mean that you are untouchable!
Tom: Are you aware, Mr. Mulder, that you are suspected of involvement with the Dutch resistance.
Mulder: That's news to me. Last time I was also imprisoned on under false accusation. I think this is again a misunderstanding.
Peter: I am sorry!? Last time you were imprisoned for two months because of helping Jews. That's not a false accusation, that's just a fact.
Mulder: I am only helping poor people to survive these cold winters.
Peter: You are not just helping poor people. You are helping Jews!
Tom: This time you are not only helping but also giving them shelter. Is this true?!
Mulder: ...
Tom: Do you deny this?
*Slams on the table* 
Peter: Answer the question!
Mulder: I indeed help poor people and do not make difference between them. Although I am not give people shelter. 
Peter: You maintain this feeble lie?
Tom: If you have nothing to hide, then we will take a look in your house!
Mulder: Go and take a look. There is no evidence for this accusation.

Peter: We are here to ask you some questions about Jan Mulder.
Peter: As you probably know by now, Mulder has been inprisoned, because of suspicion of involvement with the Dutch resistance.
Tom: He claims he has no connection.
Peter: You are a close friend of him, do you meet often?
Dekker: Yes we do actually. However he is truly a good person.
Peter: You know he was arrested and convicted for two months of prion?
Dekker: I can assure you that he has no connection to the dutch resistance. 
Dekker: He is a very busy man, however a always makes time for me.
Dekker: I don't see how he could juggle both his time working for the resistance and his his obligations as pastor.
Peter: Then how do you explain the tip leading to Mulder?
Dekker: Whoever sent that tip, the pastor is an easy target, because arrested before.
Dekker: He helps the poor, like he always has done. It's a pity that he is suspected instead of rewarded for helping the poors.
Peter: He is not the victim here!
Dekker: All he is trying to do is help people, he does not want to offend anybody.
Tom: Unlike you. 
Dekker: Me?
Tom: You have multuple times refused to support organisations that could really use the money, like the Winterhulp for example.
Dekker: I refuse to give money to those who prioritizes one person above the other. 
Tom: Maybe if you gave some money, there would be no destinction between the two because there would be enough for everyone.
Dekker: I admire your optimism.
Dekker: If this is all you have on Mr. Mulder, I am looking forward to his release soon.

*Anna gets hit with a ruler*
Anna: Please stop. 
Wiegmann: Tell. Me. The. Names.
Anna: ...
Peter: We already heard you in the Westernchurch. 
Peter: You are conspiring against us. You are spies trying to deciper how much men power and money we have.
Wiegmann: I knew the moment I saw you, that you were up to no good. 
Peter: She has a father doesn't she?
Wiegmann: Your father asked for you. He begged me to set you free, but I knew we would soon meet again.

Anna: You disgust me. There is nothing you can do about this. I will tell you nothing. 
Wiegmann: Nothing I can do?
Anna: You failed to see us when we were meeting right under your noses. 
Anna: You're just incompetent and we all know it!
Wiegmann: THAT'S ENOUGH! You think you can just waltz in here and kill us all, don't you?
*Wiegmann slaps Anna in her face with a ruler*
Wiegmann: But I know just the remedy.

Peter: I suppose this was your last day.
Peter: *Peter leaves

Wiegmann: De Wit, you imbicle.
Wiegmann: I hope for your sake, De Wit, that the other two resistance members will be caught. Otherwise it can be your last day.
Peter: *Comes in*
Peter: The other member says nothing valuable at the moment. He does claim that this thing was her idea. 
Wiegmann: Find that girl, now! I don't care how you do it!
Tom: I just heard that the other resistance member has been shot two streets further by officers. 
Wiegmann: So the other officers are doing good work, while you are just standing her. Get that girl!

Saturday 11;10, Sicherheitspolizei, General Office 

Wiegmann: So let's get this clear?! You again took this useless girl in, while you actually had to inspect Mulder's office!
Peter: This girl might be related to the resistance.
Wiegmann: She better is, for your sake! Get out of my sight!
Both: Yes, sir!
Peter: Shall we interrogate her first, before we go look into that office?
Tom: Sure. 
Tom: Why are you so sure she is part of the resistance? I don't know for sure.
Peter: I saw her proabably before you did. I hid behind a pillar and heard their entire conversation. 
Tom: What are you doing there anyway? 
Peter: I can ask you the same thing? I always try to pray at least once a day, what's your excuse?
Tom: Praying before work, I always try to do that. Although I usually sleep in. Hahaha.
Peter: That's a step in the right direction. Who knows, maybe we will make a devout catholic of you yet.

Saturday 12;10, Sicherheitspolizei, Interrogation Room

Anna:...
Peter: It doesn't look so good for you. 
Tom: Investegation 2.58, Saturday just after 12:00, the 16th of January, 1943. 
Tom: Interrogation on charge of incorrect statements during interrogation and suspected involvement with the Dutch resistance.
Tom: State your name and occupation please.
Anna: Anna Koning, Student.
Peter: So can you explain why you were in the Westernchurch?
Anna: I have already told you why.
Peter: We have a clip of you stating that you are not religious.
Peter: I don't have the patience to talk in circles. I heard your entire little conversation.
Peter: Trying to play spies are you? Spying on the NSB and our men power. 
Anna: Wha- What are you taking about?
Peter: You're involvement in the Dutch resistance.
Anna: I'm not part of the Dutch resistance.
Peter: Then prove it, give me the names of the people in you're so called bible group and I will go ask them.
Anna: I-I...
Anna: Do you have proof?
Peter: I don't need any. Unlike you, I'm not a liar. 
Anna: You can't just make up evidence?
Peter: ARE YOU CALLING ME A LIAR?
Tom: Anna, it's over. 
Anna: I-I don't know what you are talking about. I swear. 
Peter: You're father maybe does. I feel like we should pay him a visit.
Anna: Leave my father out of this, he has done nothing wrong.
Peter: That is for us to decide, not you. Maybe you can share a cell together. 
Tom: It doesn't have to be this way. If you give us the names of the other members. 
Tom: You are done for either way.
Tom: We will find the other members soon enough anyway. 
Peter: You probably still have some contact information at home.
Tom: You can save your father. 
Anna: No... I won't. 
Peter: Fine. I hoped you'd say that. I will tell your father you said goodbye!
Tom: Anna being noble isn't worth it.
Anna: We will see. Won't we.
