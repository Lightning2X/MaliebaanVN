<<Scene @ blackscreen>>

This story is based on real life events.
However, all characters appearing in this work - while inspired by history - are fictitious.
After the story ends, we will tell you what really happened.

It's the winter of 1943. A little more than three years ago, the German forces invaded the Netherlands in what is now described as World War II.
Resources are scarce and your mother fell ill last winter. Her recovery is slow. The only chance to provide her with the medicine and food she needs is to throw others to the very wolves that feed you.
This is the situation of Tom De Wit, a member of the Sicherheitspolizei.
The Sicherheitspolizei was the state's security agency for political and criminal investigation.
Tom is rather conflicted. He primarily joined the SiPo because of the lifesaving-perks it offered in these cold winters, but also found his work to be to the detriment of prosecuted minorities.
In this coming week your actions will decide the fate of various people, including your own and you mother's...
In life there is no good ending, there are only choices. And we decide if the consequences are worth it.
Choose wisely.

Tom: We do? What is our task?
Peter: Apparently pastor Mulder is taken in again.
Tom: That's his second arrest, isn't it?
Peter: Well, well. You can count! However, it's our turn to interrogate him.
Tom: What is he arrested for this time?
Peter: Have you already heard of the anonymous tip that we received yesterday?
Tom: No, what is it about?
Peter: The person that tipped us about pastor Mulder thinks he has a connection with the resistance.
Tom: Good gracious me! That vague tip must have come from a desperate person of the NSB or Dutch police looking for some money.
Peter: Hey, donâ€™t talk about our mates like that. Take the case serious Tom. We can prove ourselves here!
Tom: Alright, alright, I will. I only hope Mulder stops making it so difficult for himself.
Peter: Hahaha, if he did we wouldn't have a job. And we do need those food rations...

Peter: Investigation 2.39. Thursday morning around 08;35, the 14th of December, 1943.
Peter: State your name and occupation please. You probably know the drill by now.
Mulder: Jan Mulder, pastor at the local church here at the Lime Tree Lane.
Tom: Mr. Mulder? Do you know why you are here again?
Mulder: No, not really. Just like the last time.
Peter: Don't act innocent! You know what you have done. The fact that you are a pastor does not mean that you are untouchable!
Tom: Are you aware, Mr. Mulder, that you are suspected of involvement with the Dutch resistance.
Mulder: That's news to me. Last time I was also imprisoned under false accusation. I think this is - once again - a misunderstanding.
Peter: I am sorry!? Last time you were imprisoned for two months because of helping Jews. That's not a false accusation, that's just a fact.
Mulder: I am only helping poor people to survive these cold winters.
Peter: You are not just helping poor people. You are helping Jews!
Tom: This time you are not just helping them - you are giving them shelter. Or, at least, that's what I'm reading here. Is that true?!
Mulder: ...
Tom: Do you deny this?
*Slams on the table* 
Peter: Answer the question!
Mulder: I help poor people and do not make a distinction between them. However, I am not sheltering people. 
Peter: You maintain this feeble lie?
Tom: If you have nothing to hide, then we will take a look in your house!
Mulder: Go and take a look. There is no evidence for this accusation.

Peter: Why were you so easy on him?
Tom: Mr. Mulder used to do a lot of charity work in the Sterrenwijk. He helped us, while others blamed us for being poor. 
Tom: I feel like I owe him at least some politeness. 
Peter: Ah, I can respect that. But we do have a job to do. This case can help us both!
Peter: How is your mom doing?
Tom: Fine, same as usual. 
Peter: Still ill, is she? If you need me to jump in, just say it.

Tom: Any updates on the case?
Peter: Apparently there are Jews in hiding, sir.
Wiegmann: Yes of course, I could see that when they were taken in! Only valuable information, please.
Wiegmann: Did you ask about pastor Mulder? And have the residents already been found?
Peter: The residents have not been found... yet. We will try to get more information out of the captives.
Peter: However, the Jews said they heard the pastor talk to someone very often. They didn't know his name, though.
Tom: Oh, I just received more info about Mr. Mulder. He is a really close friend of archbishop Dekker.
Wiegmann: That would be very likely, yes!
Tom: We are not certain that it is Mr. Dekker, though, sir.

Dekker: If that is what you want.
Peter: Let's get to business, shall we?
Peter: We are here to ask you some questions about Jan Mulder.
Peter: As you probably know by now, Mulder has been arrested, because of suspicion of involvement with the Dutch resistance.
Tom: He claims he has no connection.
Peter: You are a close friend of him, we've heard. Do you meet often?
Dekker: Yes, we do actually. He is truly a good person.
Peter: You know he was arrested and convicted for helping Jews, spending two months in prison?
Dekker: I can assure you that he has no connection to the dutch resistance. 
Dekker: He is a very busy man, despite always making time for me.
Dekker: I don't see how he could juggle both his obligations as pastor and working for the resistance.
Peter: Then, how do you explain the tip leading to Mulder?
Dekker: Whoever sent that tip, the pastor is an easy target. He has been arrested before.
Dekker: He helps the poor, like he always has done. It's a pity that he is suspected instead of rewarded for helping the poors.
Peter: He is not the victim here!
Dekker: All he is trying to do is help people. He does not mean to offend anybody.
Tom: Unlike you. 
Dekker: Me?
Tom: You have refused to support organisations that could really use the money, like the Winterhulp. Multiple times too.
Dekker: I refuse to give money to those who prioritize one person above the other. 
Tom: Maybe if you gave some money, there would be no distinction between the two as there would be enough for everyone.
Dekker: I admire your optimism.
Dekker: If this is all you have on Mr. Mulder, I am looking forward to his release soon.
<<if $arrestedhiders>>
Peter: Yesterday, a family was taken in next to the pastor's house. They told us about your secret meetings.
Tom: According to the family they could hear you talk, quite frequently.

Wiegmann: STOP! I arrest you on suspicion of espionage.
Peter: The girl's name is Anna Koning - she was the girl that stuck out her tongue and ran out of the church, sir.
Tom: Another ran away, but officers are after him. This man is unknown.
Wiegmann: I see. I see.
Anna: There is no need for the gun.
Man: We were just standing here.
Wiegmann: Doing what? I know what you were doing. You were spying, maybe even to plan an assassination on me.
Wiegmann: Officers, take them back to the office. I will keep them under shot.

Tom: Investigation 2.58, Sunday just before 13:27, the 16th of January, 1943. 
Tom: Interrogation on the charge of possession of guns and violence against members of the Sicherheitspolizei.
Anna: I... I-
Wiegmann: SHUT UP.
*Wiegmann slaps Anna on her fingers with a ruler*
Anna: Aaaagh.
Wiegmann: Tell me the names off your "friends"!
Anna: I-I won't.
*Anna gets hit with a ruler*
Anna: Please stop. 
Wiegmann: Tell. Me. The. Names.
Anna: ...
Peter: We already heard you in the Easternchurch. 
Peter: You are conspiring against us. You are spies trying to decipher how much men power and money we have.
Wiegmann: I knew the moment I saw you, that you were up to no good. 
Peter: She has a father doesn't she?
Wiegmann: Your father asked for you. He begged me to set you free, but I knew we would soon meet again.
Tom: Maybe her father wants to talk in her stead?
Anna: ....
Anna: Y-You disgust me.
Tom: What is it you came here to do today?
Anna: I came to save my friends who are held here unjustly.
Wiegmann: UNJUSTLY!
*Wiegmann slaps Anna on her fingers with a ruler*
Anna: You disgust me. There is nothing you can do about this. I will tell you nothing. 
Wiegmann: Nothing I can do?
Anna: You failed to see us when we were meeting right under your noses.
Anna: You're just incompetent and we all know it!
Wiegmann: THAT'S ENOUGH! You think you can just waltz in here and kill us all, don't you?
*Wiegmann slaps Anna in her face with a ruler*
Wiegmann: But I know just the remedy.
*Wiegmann leaves the room in a hurried pace*
Peter: I suppose this was your last day.
*Peter leaves the room*
Tom: You tried to kill us. 
Anna: I-I'm sorry... 
*Anna starts crying*
Anna: Can you... please contact my father and tell him to run?
-> Perhaps.
   <<set $suspicion to $suspicion + 1>>

Wiegmann: She better is, for your sake! Get out of my sight!
Both: Yes, sir!
Peter: Shall we interrogate her first, before we go look into that office?
Tom: Sure. 
Tom: Why are you so sure that she is part of the resistance? I don't know for sure.
Peter: I saw her before you did. I hid behind a pillar and heard their entire conversation. 
Tom: What were you doing there anyway? 
Peter: I can ask you the same thing? I always try to pray at least once a day, what's your excuse?
Tom: Praying before work, I always try to do that. Although I usually sleep in. Hahaha.

Anna: Anna Koning, Student.
Peter: So can you explain why you were in the Easternchurch?
Anna: I have already told you why.
Peter: We have a clip of you stating that you are not religious.
Peter: Anyway, I don't have the patience to talk in circles. I listened in on your little conversation in the church.
Peter: Trying to play spies, are you? Spying on the NSB and our manpower. 
Anna: Wha- What are you taking about?
Peter: You're involved in the Dutch resistance.
Anna: I'm not part of the Dutch resistance.
Peter: Then prove it, give me the names of the people in you're so-called bible group and I will go ask them.
Anna: I...I-
Anna: Do you have proof?
Peter: I don't need any. Unlike you, I'm not a liar.
Anna: You can't just make up evidence?

Tom: Anna, it's over.
Anna: I... I don't know what you are talking about. I swear. 
Peter: Your father maybe does. I feel like we should pay him a visit.
Anna: Leave my father out of this, he has done nothing wrong.
Peter: That is for us to decide, not you. Maybe you can share a cell together. 
Tom: It doesn't have to be this way. If you give us the names of the other members. 
Tom: You are done for either way.
Tom: We will find the other members soon enough anyway. 
Peter: You probably still have some contact information at home.
Tom: You can save your father. 
Anna: No... I won't. 
Peter: Fine. I hoped you'd say that. I will tell your father you said goodbye!

Wiegmann: I always knew there was something off about you.

Dekker: I realize that you have had money problems, Mr. De Wit.

Dekker: I need your help.

Dekker: Because I think I can trust you. The family on number 80 vouched for your generosity.
Tom: You mean that family that lives next to Mulder?
Dekker: The very same. You see, I help more families just like them.
Dekker: Because you let these people go, their child could be saved.
Dekker: You also released the resistance girl in the Easternchurch that day.

Dekker: I was in the church that day. Happens to be part of being an archbishop.
Dekker: You have shown courage and truly tried to save those who are unjustly prosecuted.

Dekker: Therefore, I humbly ask, can you help me?
Dekker: I shall provide food for your family if so.

   Dekker: It's for an organisation called Utrechts KindercomitÃ©.
