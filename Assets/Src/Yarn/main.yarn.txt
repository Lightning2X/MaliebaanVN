Peter: Hey Tom, there you are.
Tom: Ha Peter, back from Herr Wiegmann I see.
Peter: No, actually... We got a new case.
Tom: We do. What is our task?
Peter: Apparently pastor Mulder is taken in again.
Tom: That's his second arrest, isn't it? 
Peter: Well, well. You can count! However it's ourturn to interrogate him. 
Tom: What is he arrested for this time?
Peter: Have you already heard of the anonymous new tip that we received yesterday?
Tom: No, what is it about?
Peter: The person that tipped us about pastor Mulder, thinks he has a connection with the resistance.
Tom: O help, that vague tip must have come from a desperate person of the NSB or Dutch police looking for some money.
Peter: He, don’t talk about our mates like that. Take the case serious Tom. We can proof ourselves!
Tom: Alright, alright, I will. I only hope Mulder stops making it so difficult for himself.
Peter: Hahaha, if he did we won’t have a job and we need food though.

Peter: Investegation 2.39, Thursday morning around 08:35, the 14th of December, 1943. 
Peter: State your name and occupation please. You'd probably know the drill by now.
Mulder: Jan Mulder, pastor at the local church here at the Lime Tree lane.
Tom: Mr. Mulder? Do you know why you are here again?
Mulder: No not really, just like the last time.
Peter: Don't act innocent! You know what you have done. The fact that you are a pastor does not mean that you are untouchable!
Tom: Are you aware, Mr. Mulder, that you are suspected of involvement with the Dutch resistance.
Mulder: That's news to me. Last time I was also imprisoned on under false accusation. I think this is again a misunderstanding.
Peter: I am sorry!? Last time you were imprisoned for two months because of helping Jews. That's not a false accusation, that's just a fact.
Mulder: I am only helping poor people to survive these cold winters.
Peter: You are not just helping poor people. You are helping Jews!
Tom: This time you are not only helping but also giving them shelter. Is this true?!
Mulder: ...
Tom: Do you deny this?
Noise: *Slams on the table* 
Peter: Answer the question!
Mulder: I indeed help poor people and do not make difference between them. Although I am not give people shelter. 
Peter: You maintain this feeble lie?
Tom: If you have nothing to hide, then we will take a look in your house!
Mulder: Go and take a look. There is no evidence for this accusation.

Peter: Why were you so easy on him?
Tom: Mr. Mulder used to do a lot of charity work in the Sterrenwijk. He helped us, while others blamed us for being poor. 
Tom: I feel like I owe him at least some politeness. 
Peter: Ah I can understand, but we have a job to do! This case can help us both. How is your mom doing?
Tom: Fine, same as usual. 
Peter: Still sick is she? If you need me to jump in, just say it. 
Tom: Thanks!
Peter: If we actually find something in Mulder's house and finish this case properly we might receive a reward.

Tom: Nothing special, the neighbours were cleaning their house and some stuff fell down.
Tom: Did you find anything?
Peter: Nothing really valuable as evidence or a lead. But I think we should take a look at his room in the church.
Peter: But first let's get back to the office and report our progress...
Peter: Damn, this was our chance to proof ourselves to Herr Wiegmann.

Both: Yes, Herr Wiegmann.
Peter: We did not find anything that is valuable as evidence or as a lead. But I think we should take a look at his room in the church.
Wiegmann: Let me do the thinking! We received new intel about Mr. Mulder. He is a really close friend of archbishop Dekker. So you both get out of my office and go question him.
Both: Yes, Herr Wiegmann.

Tom: Can you explain what you are doing? And where are you going to in such a hurry?
Huffelman: We were just going out for a walk.
Tom: Then there is no need for all the panic, is there?
Huffelman: We just didn't want to bother you.
Tom: Show me your identity card.
Huffelman: I don't have it with me.
Tom: Well what are you waiting for. Go and get it!
Huffelman: I lost it...
Tom: I will arrest you for not showing an identity card.
Huffelman: No, No, please. I have a child. A little girl. Please don't do this. Don't you have a family?
-> Tom: Okay, let this be a warning and fix your stuff!
    Peter: What are you doing?
    Tom: Peter? Are you already here?
    Peter: Yes, don't let that men go! Or you will arrest him or I will do it.

Wiegmann: Impressive work.
Wiegmann: Unlike all the others, you actually managed to achieve something.
Wiegmann: Where is Meyer?
Tom: Interrogating the witness.
Tom: I'm instead focusing on the case of pastor Mulder, sir.
Wiegmann: That's what I like to hear.
*Peter enters the room*
Peter: Sir!
Wiegmann: Meyer. Good work today. 
Peter: Thank you, sir.
Tom: Any updates about the case?
Peter: Apparently they are Jews in hiding sir.
Wiegmann: Yes of course, I could see that when they were taken in! I talk about valuable information!
Wiegmann: Did you ask about pastor Mulder? And are the residents already found?
Peter: The residents are not found yet, but we will try to get more information out of them.
Peter: However the Jews told they heard the pastor talk to someone very often.
Tom: O I just received more info about Mr. Mulder. He is a really close friend of archbishop Dekker.
Wiegmann: That could be very likely!
Tom: We are not certain, that it is Mr. Dekker, sir. 
Wiegmann: I give the orders! Go question Dekker tommorow morning!
Peter: Yes, sir.
