      real life events.\nHowever, all characters appearing in this work - while inspired
      by history - are fictitious.\nAfter the story ends, we will tell you what really
      happened.\n\nIt's the winter of 1943. A little more than three years ago, the
      German forces invaded the Netherlands in what is now described as World War
      II.\nResources are scarce and your mother fell ill last winter. Her recovery
      is slow. The only chance to provide her with the medicine and food she needs
      is to throw others to the very wolves that feed you.\nThis is the situation
      of Tom De Wit, a member of the Sicherheitspolizei.\nThe Sicherheitspolizei
      was the state's security agency for political and criminal investigation.\nTom
      is rather conflicted. He primarily joined the SiPo because of the lifesaving-perks
      it offered in these cold winters, but also found his work to be to the detriment
      of prosecuted minorities.\nIn this coming week your actions will decide the
      fate of various people, including your own and you mother's...\nIn life there
      is no good ending, there are only choices. And we decide if the consequences
      are worth it.\nChoose wisely.\n\n\n[[Go to work|ready]]\n"

      Jan Mulder, pastor at the local church here at the Lime Tree Lane.\nTom: Mr.
      Mulder? Do you know why you are here again?\nMulder: No, not really. Just like

      fact that you are a pastor does not mean that you are untouchable!\nTom: Are
      you aware, Mr. Mulder, that you are suspected of involvement with the resistance.\nMulder:
      That's news to me. Last time I was also imprisoned under false accusation.
      I think this is - once again - a misunderstanding.\nPeter: I am sorry!? Last
      time you were imprisoned for two months because of helping Jews. That's not
      a false accusation, that's just a fact.\nMulder: I am only helping poor people
      to survive these cold winters.\nPeter: You are not just helping poor people.
      You are helping Jews!\nTom: This time you are not just helping them - you are
      giving them shelter. Or, at least, that's what I'm reading here. Is that true?!\nMulder:
      ...\nTom: Do you deny this?\n*Slams on the table* \nPeter: Answer the question!\nMulder:
      I help poor people and do not make a distinction between them. However, I am
      not sheltering people. \nPeter: You maintain this feeble lie?\nTom: If you
      have nothing to hide, then we will take a look in your house!\nMulder: Go and
      take a look. There is no evidence for this accusation.\n[[Walk to pastor Mulder's

      in prison?\nDekker: I can assure you that he has no connection to the resistance.
      \nDekker: He is a very busy man, despite always making time for me.\nDekker:
      I don't see how he could juggle both his obligations as pastor and working
      for the resistance.\nPeter: Then, how do you explain the tip leading to Mulder?\nDekker:
      Whoever sent that tip, the pastor is an easy target. He has been arrested before.\nDekker:
      He helps the poor, like he always has done. It's a pity that he is suspected
      instead of rewarded for helping the poors.\nPeter: He is not the victim here!\nDekker:

      could really use the money, like the Winterhulp. Multiple times too.\nDekker:
      I refuse to give money to those who prioritize one person above the other.
      \nTom: Maybe if you gave some money, there would be no distinction between

      your name and occupation please.\nAnna: Anna Koning, Student.\nPeter: So can
      you explain why you were in the Easternchurch?\nAnna: I have already told you
      why. I was with my study group.\nPeter: Anyway, I don't have the patience to
      talk in circles. I listened in on your little conversation in the church.\nPeter:
      Trying to play spies, are you? Spying on the NSB and our manpower. \nAnna:
      Wha- What are you taking about?\nPeter: You're involved in the resistance.\nAnna:
      I'm not part of the resistance.\nPeter: Then prove it, give me the names of
      the people in you're so-called bible group and I will go ask them.\nAnna: I...I-\nAnna:

      it's over.\nAnna: I... I don't know what you are talking about. I swear. \nPeter:
      Your father maybe does. I feel like we should pay him a visit.\nAnna: Leave
      my father out of this, he has done nothing wrong.\nPeter: That is for us to
      decide, not you. Maybe you can share a cell together. \nTom: It doesn't have
      to be this way. If you give us the names of the other members. \nTom: You are
      done for either way.\nTom: We will find the other members soon enough anyway.
      \nPeter: You probably still have some contact information at home.\nTom: You
      can save your father. \nAnna: No... I won't. \nPeter: Fine. I hoped you'd say
      that. I will tell your father you said goodbye!\nTom: Anna, being noble isn't
